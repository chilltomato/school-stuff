                is it safe? do I need to know how to swim?
            </div>
            <div class="answer" >
                the trip is overall safe, but just in case, all guides have three years rafting experience certified in wilderness first aid. The most common injury is sunburns and stuff on land. Everyone has to wear a coast guard approved life jacket of flotation device (that's provided). Many non swimmers have a great time, but we recomended learning to swim before hand. The guide will give the safety information like what to do if you fall off the raft.            </div>

                where is the rafts?
            </div>
            <div class="answer" >
                You will find the rafts near the water. You will know it is there because it isn't the color of the ground and it is raft shaped. You will be suprised with how many times someone went to go rafting, and then came back complaining about there not being a raft. we found the raft everytime we checked, so we don't know if someone is messing with us, or if 10 diffrent people decided to mess with us.

                What animals are there? should I be concerned about them?
            </div>
            <div class="answer" >
                 On the trip you will find many animals in the mountaness region, but there is mostly just goats. The rafting experience is designed so you can see them but you don't go near them. Also, stop reporting a ram creeply stairing at you. That's just the owner's pet , Gerard. He just likes to watch people, nothing more. Stop making up stories of him eating the rafts.

                Can this entertain my kids? what age ranges do I follow.
            </div>
            <div class="answer" >
                This trip is for kids of all ages, but kids 8 and up seem to enjoy it the most. Our tours can entertain them quite well. The areas are quite beautiful, and you'll never know what you might see. The rapids keeps thing very intresting as well. Don't forget the guides, they tell good stories, some of which are true.
