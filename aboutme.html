    <p>Hello everyone, let me introduce myslef. I'm someone that's homeschooled and is taking this class to work twords my degree. I am also taking pathway classes alongside this. I hope to learn a thing or two from this class. I'm a senior in high school</p>
    <p>my hobbies include music production, gaming, and making Youtube videos, though I need to get back to making youtube videos. Learning about web design should help me learn how websites work. Maybe I can even make my own website.</p>
    <p>I love how byu idaho is online, it is really nice to be able to do stuff from home</p>
